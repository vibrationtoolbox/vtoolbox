% VTB7
%
% VTB7_1   is an example of finding a power spectral density
%          of data. The power spectral density of a signal
%          containing .5 Hz and 1.59 Hz signals is plotted.
% VTB7_2   generates the discrete frequency response
%          function (H(iw)) between two signals.
% VTB7_2EX VTB7_2EX.MAT is an example data file for VTB7_2.
% VTB7_3   A set of files numbered from VTB7_3_1.MAT to
%          VTB7_3_6.MAT exist which contain discrete frequency
%          response functions.  After loading the data,
%          plot(FreqV,abs(Xfer)) will give the magnitude,
%          plot(FreqV,angle(Xfer)) will give the phase
%          plot, and plot(Xfer) will give the Nyquist plot.
%          Note the differences between experimental
%          data and what you would expect from theory.
% VTB7_4   Curve fit to a FRF. Used in modal analysis
% VTB7_5   Frequency Response Function from second order system matrices.
% VTB7_6   Matrix iteration + deflation solution of large eigenvalue
%          problems.
